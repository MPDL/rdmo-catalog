# General
This RDMO catalogue supports the writing of a Software Management Plan. This questionnaire was developed by the Max Planck Digital Library in the Collections area in late summer and autumn 2022. It can be used to create a software management plan in RDMO.

# Development
This catalogue was developed through many conversations and iterations. It represents an attempt or approximation of what a Software Management Plan could possibly be. The main focus from our side was on added value for scientists who write software for their research themselves, but have not learned how to do this or have learned it only a little. At the same time, such an SMP can also be helpful in advising information and infrastructure experts.

Furthermore, this SMP template was inspired by some documentations, specially:
* https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/software-management-plans
* https://opencarp.org/about/software-management-plan
* https://zenodo.org/record/7248877
* https://biohackrxiv.org/k8znb/

# Implementing
The catalogue uses some of the generic elements from RDMO. Therefore, all generic elements from "Conditions", "Domain", "Options" and "Questions" must already be implemented in advance.
To use this SMP, the additional SMP elements "Condition", "Domains" and "Questions" must then be imported into the own RDMO system. The respective order can be found in the generic readme of the RDMO and must be observed.

# Transferability
This catalogue uses many custom domains, as the generic RDMO elements do not always cover the specific aspects of software. For this reason, the existing views in RDMO cannot be used for this catalogue, or only to a very limited extent.

# Feedback
Of course, we are always happy to receive feedback: rdmo@mpdl.mpg.de.
